        <h2>Stock Market Analysis</h2>
        <p>I created this these algorithms and analysis tools to practice my software/ML skills and learn more about the market, all while potentially making some money on the side. There's a few tools that are currently availabe for use:<br>
        <h3>Financial Technical Indicator Analysis</h3>
       	Use existing technical indicators (MACD, RSI, OBV) as inputs into machine learning (SVR) to predict percent price changes. Parameters for data preprocessing and SVR algorithm are user adjustable.<br>
        <h3>Twitter Sentiment Analysis</h3>
        Use NLP to correlate tweets with market changes and use Naive Bayes to predict stock performance from recent tweets. Parameters for data preprocessing and NB algorithm are user adjustable.<br>
        <h3>Merger Arbitrage Analysis</h3>
        Find the expected value of acquisition for a publicly traded company with an announced acquisition using a market reference. At each user specified percent change in probabiliy of acquisition, provide the top tweet with user specified search text for that date of change.<br><br>

        There is not a lot of form validation, so just double check your inputs if you hit errors. You should definitely put all your life savings in this. <br><br>
