        <h2>Stock Price Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Hello there, and welcome to my lazily formatted web app!</h3>
        <p>Use my machine learning algorithms (cue other fancy terms) to predict market prices and make lots of money (or lose even more - who really knows, just flip a coin).<br><br>
        This web app currently supports one lonely method of analysis:<br>
        1. Financial Technical Indicator Analysis<br><br>
       	I create pretty plots and use technical indicators as inputs into a machine learning to predict price changes. Parameters are user adjustable so have it. If you don't know what they mean, too bad and look them up on Google.<br><br>
        Once upon a time, I had a cool Twitter sentiment predictor for market prices, but Twitter locked the secret doors that GetOldTweets3 used. Lame. BUT with the rise of the reddit mob (hi GameStop 2021), I'd like to analyze reddit sentiment to predict stock prices. When I get some free time... Eventually. <br><br>
        LASTLY, I was too lazy to put in form validation. So if you get errors, it's your own dang fault. Definitely not my code ;) <br><br>
        P.S. It's definitely a good idea to trust all your life savings on this. <br><br>
