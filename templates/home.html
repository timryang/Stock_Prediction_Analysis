        <h2>Stock Price Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Hello and welcome to my lazily formatted web app!</h3>
        <p>Use my machine learning algorithms to predict market prices and make lots of money (or lose even more).<br><br>
        I currently support one lonely method of analysis:<br>
        1. Financial Technical Indicator Analysis<br><br>
       	I create pretty plots and use technical indicators as inputs into machine learning to predict price changes. Parameters are user adjustable so have at it. If you don't know what they are, look them up on Google.<br><br>
        I had a cool Twitter sentiment predictor for market prices, but Twitter locked the secret doors that GetOldTweets3 used. BUT with the rise of reddit influence (GameStop 2021), I want to analyze reddit sentiment in relation to stock prices. When I get some free time... <br><br>
        LASTLY, I was too lazy to put in form validation. So if you get errors, it's your own fault. Definitely not my code :) <br><br>
        You should definitely put all your life savings in this. <br><br>
